# German practice tools

## Install

The program can be installed using `make install`. But it needs a $BINDIR directory, to know where to install it.

It is used as:

	BINDIR=/path/to/bin/ make install

for example:

	BINDIR=/usr/bin/ make install

or

	BINDIR=/usr/local/bin make install

## Usage

	german-practice <game> <iterations>

Calling just `german-practice` displays the help.
